      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p class="effective-date">Effective date: July 20, 2024</p>

      <p>
        Welcome to Stronger Chest - At Home! This Privacy Policy explains how we
        collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our
        application. Please read this privacy policy carefully. If you do not
        agree with the terms of this privacy policy, please do not access the
        application.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>
        We only collect minimal information necessary to provide you with a
        personalized experience. Specifically, the information we may collect
        includes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>User Data:</strong> Your weight and height, which are
          essential for workout recommendations and calorie tracking.
          Additionally, you may optionally provide your date of birth for more
          personalized guidance. This data is not mandatory and will remain
          stored locally on your device unless you update it through the app.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Purchase Data:</strong> Information related to your
          subscriptions or in-app purchases, such as whether you have purchased
          Pro Access, which is used to manage your access to premium features.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>2. Use of Your Information</h2>
      <p>We use the information collected to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Provide workout recommendations based on your weight and height.
        </li>
        <li>Enable Pro Access features after a subscription is purchased.</li>
        <li>Allow offline access to the app once Pro Access is activated.</li>
        <li>
          Improve app functionality and ensure a seamless user experience.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Offline Access and Data Usage</h2>
      <p>
        The app is designed to allow offline usage, especially after a user
        purchases a subscription. Your data, such as weight, height, and date of
        birth, remains stored locally on your device and is not shared or
        transmitted to external servers.
      </p>

      <h2>4. In-App Purchases and Subscriptions</h2>
      <p>
        The app offers in-app purchases for unlocking Pro Access features. When
        you purchase a subscription, the transaction is handled securely by the
        app store you use (e.g., Google Play Store or Apple App Store). We do
        not store any payment details.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Security of Your Information</h2>
      <p>
        We prioritize the security of your personal data. All information you
        provide is stored locally on your device, and we do not transmit or
        share it externally. While we strive to use reasonable security
        measures, please be aware that no method of data storage is completely
        secure.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Policy for Children</h2>
      <p>
        We do not knowingly collect data from or market our application to
        children under the age of 13. If we become aware that data from a child
        under 13 has been inadvertently collected, we will delete it
        immediately.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes
        in our practices or for legal and regulatory reasons. Any updates will
        be posted on this page with an updated effective date. Continued use of
        the app after any changes constitutes your acceptance of the updated
        Privacy Policy.
